<p><strong>What the heck is "planning poker"?</strong></p>
<p>It has to do with agile software development.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker">Read this</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Is this thing free?  As in beer?  As in speech?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.  Yes.  Somewhat, under the MIT License.</p>

<p><strong>Why yet another planning poker app?</strong></p>
<p>I needed a planning poker app that worked with IE8 and I couldn't find one; also, all of the other planning poker apps had extra features that I didn't need.  And it gave me an excuse to try out SignalR.</p>

<p><strong>Where do I get the code?</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/RationalGeek/bespoker">GitHub page</a> for the project.</p>

<p><strong>Why is this called "bespoker"?</strong></p>
<p>Many reasons:  1) Naming things is hard.  2) It has the word "poker" in it.  3) "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bespoke">Bespoke</a>" is a word meaning "custom made". 4) There were no other projects with that name on GitHub.</p>

<p><strong>Who made this thing?</strong></p>
<p>This was made by Justin Kohlhepp.  Check out <a href="http://rationalgeek.com">my personal page</a> for other things related to me.</p>
